### Overview

This course teaches you the fundamentals you need, in order to be an informed, 
well-rounded practitioner of artificial intelligence. At a high level, it 
focuses on three topics: logic, search, and probability. While 
you likely have some experience with all three of these subjects in previous
classes, the focus of this course will be on: (a) coming to terms with the
fact that almost everything we want to do is NP-hard or worse, and
then (b) sometimes successfully doing it anyway.


### Coursework

**Homework:** There will be short but very regular homework assignments. 
They are important to do, so that you can learn the material well. It is 
less important that you get the answers correct than that you give a good 
faith effort. We will spend a good chunk of class time tackling homework 
assignments together. You will be required to hand in homework solutions, 
with the freedom to skip two homeworks over the course of the semester 
without penalty. I would, however, encourage you not to exercise this 
freedom unless necessary.

**Projects:** There will be four projects during the course. These are the
famous “Pac-Man” projects developed at UC Berkeley. You will have 
approximately two weeks to complete each project.

**Exams:** There will be three exams during the course: two midterms and a 
final. Each exam is weighted equally and covers one module of the course.
In other words, there will be one exam about logic, one exam about search,
and one exam about probability. The final will not be comprehensive of the
entire course and will not be worth more than the midterms. This means that
once you take the logic exam, you can forget everything you ever knew about
logic, but I hope you don’t.



### Collaboration

Collaborating on homework and projects is permitted, but each student must 
write up homework independently, and must do the actual programming on the 
projects independently (no cutting and pasting somebody else’s code!) Also,
 you should acknowledge the names of anyone who you collaborated with.


### Reading Assignments

Reading assignments will be posted on the website a minimum of two days 
in advance of each lecture. I will assume that the reading is done prior 
to lecture. 


### Disability Accommodation

If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an
accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both your professor and the
Office of Disability Support Services, disability-services@reed.edu or 
503-517-7921 as early as possible in the semester. Please be aware that 
requests may take several weeks to implement once
approved, and that accommodations are not retroactive.

### Covid-19 Policies

**Face Masks:** All members of the class (students, faculty, staff) are 
expected to wear face masks during class. If a student does not wear a mask, 
they will be asked to leave. If a student continues to not 
wear a face mask in future classes, they may be dropped 
from the course. 

**Health Checking:** Students, staff, and faculty are expected to complete a 
health self-assessment each day to check for symptoms of COVID-19. This 
assessment tool will be available as a Qualtrics survey.  Those experiencing 
COVID-19 symptoms should not attend an in-person course (see details below). 

**In-person course attendance (Sections 1 and 2):** Each community member
has an individual responsibility to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
If you are ill, self-isolating and/or quarantining due to possible exposure 
to coronavirus or to other infectious diseases, your in-person attendance 
in class is not required (and you will not be penalized for not attending 
in-person classes). Self-isolation is the recommended course of action
for anyone experiencing flu-like symptoms, whether due to possible coronavirus
or to other illnesses.  Please stay at home if you feel sick, and most
especially if you think you may have an infectious disease. 
You should not attend class if you have tested positive for COVID-19, or
if you have received notification or advice from the college or a health
professional (including HCC staff) to quarantine or self-isolate.
The CDC suggests that people with the following symptoms may have COVID:
fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue,
muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat,
congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea.  As always, please
consult a medical professional (members of the HCC or otherwise) if you have
any questions about your health or health safety.
Students who are quarantining or self-isolating should
attend Section 3 lectures (no matter which
section you are enrolled in), to the extent that their health allows. 

If you need to miss a class, or series of classes, due to illness,
self-isolation, and/or quarantine, you are responsible for emailing me
to let me know as soon as possible.  You are also responsible for coordinating
with me to complete work that you might miss due to absences. It can be
challenging to catch up after some time out of class, so let’s collaborate
to make a plan for getting up to speed.  

Finally, please let me know right away about any technical issues you are
having with respect to accessing material provided to you during a period
away from in person class attendance.
