### Overview

This course teaches you the fundamentals you need, in order to be an informed, 
well-rounded practitioner of artificial intelligence. At a high level, it 
focuses on three topics: logic, search, and probability. While 
you likely have some experience with all three of these subjects in previous
classes, the focus of this course will be on: (a) coming to terms with the
fact that almost everything we want to do is NP-hard or worse, and
then (b) sometimes successfully doing it anyway.


### Coursework

**Homework:** There will be short but very regular homework assignments. 
They are important to do, so that you can learn the material well. It is 
less important that you get the answers correct than that you give a good 
faith effort. We will spend a good chunk of class time tackling homework 
assignments together. You will be required to hand in homework solutions, 
with the freedom to skip two homeworks over the course of the semester 
without penalty. I would, however, encourage you not to exercise this 
freedom unless necessary.

**Projects:** There will be four projects during the course. These are the
famous “Pac-Man” projects developed at UC Berkeley. You will have 
approximately two weeks to complete each project.

**Exams:** There will be three exams during the course: two midterms and a 
final. Each exam is weighted equally and covers one module of the course.
In other words, there will be one exam about logic, one exam about search,
and one exam about probability. The final will not be comprehensive of the
entire course and will not be worth more than the midterms. This means that
once you take the logic exam, you can forget everything you ever knew about
logic, but I hope you don’t.



### Collaboration

Collaborating on homework and projects is permitted, but each student must 
write up homework independently, and must do the actual programming on the 
projects independently (no cutting and pasting somebody else’s code!) Also,
 you should acknowledge the names of anyone who you collaborated with.


### Reading Assignments

Reading assignments will be posted on the website a minimum of two days 
in advance of each lecture. I will assume that the reading is done prior 
to lecture. 


### Disability Accommodation

If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an
accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both your professor and the
Office of Disability Support Services, disability-services@reed.edu or 
503-517-7921 as early as possible in the semester. Please be aware that 
requests may take several weeks to implement once
approved, and that accommodations are not retroactive.
